# Make sure none of the commands inherit usage header or description of the top-level fcli command
# Note that we define these as usage.* whereas our parent bundle defines fcli.usage.* (with fcli prefix).
# For some reason, overriding fcli.usage.* doesn't work.

# fcli sc-sast
fcli.sc-sast.usage.header = Interact with Fortify ScanCentral SAST (SC-SAST).
fcli.sc-dast.usage.description.0 = The commands in this module allow for interacting with \
  Fortify ScanCentral SAST (SC-SAST). This includes functionality like submitting and \
  managing SAST scan requests and results.  
fcli.sc-dast.usage.description.1 = %nBefore being able to interact with ScanCentral SAST, \
  a session will need to be created by passing SSC URL and credentials to the 'session login' \
  command in this module. As a best practice, 'session logout' should be run to terminate the \
  session when there are no more activities to be performed.  

# Common descriptions
delim = Change the default delimiter character when using options that accept \
  "application:version" as an argument or parameter. 
fcli.ssc.appversion.resolver.nameOrId = Application version id or <application>:<version> name.

# fcli sc-sast session
ssc-user.0 = SSC user name.
ssc-user.1 = Environment variables:%n \
  ${fcli.env.default.prefix}_SSC_USER: Shared with SSC/SC DAST%n \
  ${fcli.env.default.prefix}_SC_SAST_SSC_USER: Only SC SAST commands
ssc-password.0 = SSC password.
ssc-password.1 = Environment variables:%n \
  ${fcli.env.default.prefix}_SSC_PASSWORD: Shared with SSC/SC DAST%n \
  ${fcli.env.default.prefix}_SC_SAST_SSC_PASSWORD: Only SC SAST commands
ssc-ci-token.0 = SSC CIToken in either encoded (REST) or decoded (application) format.
ssc-ci-token.1 = Environment variables:%n \
  ${fcli.env.default.prefix}_SSC_CI_TOKEN: Shared with SSC/SC DAST%n \
  ${fcli.env.default.prefix}_SC_SAST_SSC_CI_TOKEN: Only SC SAST commands
client-auth-token.0 = ScanCentral SAST client_auth_token (shared secret) matching the client_auth_token \
  property in ScanCentral SAST Controller config.properties file. This is @|bold,underline not|@ an SSC token.
client-auth-token.1 = Environment variables:%n \
  ${fcli.env.default.prefix}_SC_SAST_CLIENT_AUTH_TOKEN

# fcli sc-sast session
fcli.sc-sast.session.usage.header = Manage ScanCentral SAST sessions (start here).
fcli.sc-sast.session.usage.description = The session commands allow for managing one or more \
  ScanCentral SAST sessions used to connect to a particular SSC/ScanCentral SAST environment \
  with particular credentials. Potentially you can have multiple open ScanCentral SAST sessions, \
  for example connecting to different SSC/ScanCentral SAST environments like DEV and PROD, \
  or connecting to the same SSC/ScanCentral SAST instance but with different credentials.
  
  # fcli sc-sast session login
fcli.sc-sast.session.login.usage.header = Create a session for interacting with ScanCentral SAST.
fcli.sc-sast.session.login.usage.description.0 = This command stores the SSC and ScanCentral SAST API \
  URL and authentication token in an encrypted session file in the fcli state data folder, for use \
  by other 'fcli sc-sast' commands to connect to the specified SSC/ScanCentral SAST instance. Option \
  values may be passed on the command line or specified through environment variables (common for \
  CI/CD pipeline use) as listed below.
fcli.sc-sast.session.login.usage.description.1 = %nWhen logging in with username and password, this \
  command will connect to SSC to generate a CIToken; the user password is not stored by fcli. When \
  logging in with a pre-generated CIToken, this token will be stored as-is. Note that due to SSC \
  limitations, fcli cannot determine when the token will expire.
fcli.sc-sast.session.login.usage.description.2 = %nFor interactive use, you may choose to keep the session \
  open until it expires. For CI/CD integrations and other automations, you should always issue a \
  logout command once work is complete. On shared/non-containerized systems, consider setting \
  FCLI_STATE_DIR or FCLI_DATA_DIR environment variables to prevent unexpected interactions between \
  different pipelines.
fcli.sc-sast.session.login.expire-in = Specify for how long the session should remain active, for example \
  1h (1 hour) or 1d (1 day).
fcli.sc-sast.session.login.ssc-url.0 = SSC URL.
fcli.sc-sast.session.login.ssc-url.1 = Environment variables:%n \
  ${fcli.env.default.prefix}_SSC_URL: Shared with SSC/SC DAST%n \
  ${fcli.env.default.prefix}_SC_SAST_SSC_URL: Only SC SAST commands
  
# fcli sc-sast session logout
fcli.sc-sast.session.logout.usage.header = Terminate ScanCentral SAST session.
fcli.sc-sast.session.logout.usage.description = This command terminates a ScanCentral SAST session \
  previously created through the 'login' command. This command will try to revoke the token passed \
  to or generated by the 'login' command (unless the --no-revoke-token option is specified), and \
  removes the session data from the fcli state data directory. 
fcli.sc-sast.session.logout.no-revoke-token = Don't revoke the token passed to or generated by the 'login' \
  command. If user name and password were specified during login, it is recommended to have the 'logout' \
  command revoke this token, to avoid exceeding SSCs maximum token limit. Note that due to SSC limitations, \
  user credentials will need to be provided to allow for token revocation. If a pre-generated token was \
  specified during login, usually you'll want to pass this option to avoid the pre-generated token from \
  being revoked.

# fcli sc-sast session list
fcli.sc-sast.session.list.usage.header = List active and expired ScanCentral SAST sessions.
fcli.sc-sast.session.list.usage.description = This commands lists all ScanCentral SAST sessions created \
  through the `login` command, as long as they haven't been explicitly terminated through the 'logout' \
  command. For sessions created using user name and password, the output of this command will show \
  session expiry date and status. For sessions created using a pre-generated token, fcli cannot display \
  this information as SSC doesn't allow for obtaining this information.

# fcli sc-sast rest
fcli.sc-sast.rest.usage.header = Interact with ScanCentral SAST Controller REST API endpoints.
fcli.sc-sast.rest.usage.description = These commands allow for direct interaction with ScanCentral SAST \
  Controller REST API endpoints, somewhat similar to using 'curl' but benefiting from standard fcli \
  functionality like session management (no need to manually specify Authorization header), rich output \
  formatting options, and query functionality.
fcli.sc-sast.rest.call.usage.header = Call an individual ScanCentral SAST Controller REST API endpoint. 
fcli.sc-sast.rest.call.no-paging = This option currently has no effect for ScanCentral SAST.
fcli.sc-sast.rest.call.no-transform = This option currently has no effect for ScanCentral SAST.
fcli.sc-sast.rest.call.transform = This option allows for performing custom transformations on the response \
  data based on a Spring Expression Language (SpEL) expression. For example, this allows for retrieving \
  data from sub-properties, or using project selection/projection. Note that the expression operates on \
  the raw response, as if --no-transform was specified before evaluating the expression.
  
# fcli sc-sast scan
fcli.sc-sast.scan.usage.header = Manage ScanCentral SAST scans.
fcli.sc-sast.scan.cancel.usage.header = Cancel a previously submitted scan request.
fcli.sc-sast.scan.start.usage.header = Start a SAST scan.
fcli.sc-sast.scan.start.mbs.heading = Options for scanning an MBS file:%n
fcli.sc-sast.scan.start.package.heading = Options for scanning a package file:%n
fcli.sc-sast.scan.start.mbs-file = MBS file to scan.
fcli.sc-sast.scan.start.package-file = Package file to scan.
fcli.sc-sast.scan.start.notify = Email address to which to send a scan completion notification.
fcli.sc-sast.scan.start.no-upload = By default, scan results will be automatically uploaded to SSC, unless the --no-upload option is provided.
fcli.sc-sast.scan.start.sensor-version = Version of the sensor on which the package should be scanned. Officially, you should select the same sensor version as the version of the ScanCentral Client used to create the package.
fcli.sc-sast.scan.status.usage.header = Get status for a previously submitted scan request.
fcli.sc-sast.scan.wait-for.usage.header = Wait for one or more scans to reach or exit specified scan statuses.
fcli.sc-sast.scan.wait-for.usage.description.0 = Although this command offers a lot of options to cover many different use cases, you can simply pass a scan id (possibly stored using --store on the 'scan start' command) to wait for completion of a single scan.
fcli.sc-sast.scan.wait-for.usage.description.1 = %nIf none of the --while or --until options are specified, this command will by default wait until the scan has completed, until the SSC upload has completed, or until the scan has been fully processed by SSC, depending on the --status-type option. If any error state or unknown state is detected, an exception will be thrown.
fcli.sc-sast.scan.wait-for.usage.description.2 = %nThe following states are currently known by fcli:
fcli.sc-sast.scan.wait-for.usage.description.3 = If --status-type is set to 'scan' or 'upload': ${fcli.sc-sast.scan.jobStates:-See fcli help output}
fcli.sc-sast.scan.wait-for.usage.description.4 = If --status-type is set to 'processing': ${fcli.sc-sast.scan.jobArtifactStates:-See fcli help output} 
fcli.sc-sast.scan.wait-for.status-type = Specify what status type to wait for. Can be one of 'scan' (wait for scan status), 'upload' (wait for SSC upload status), or 'processing' (wait for SSC artifact processing status). Default value is 'processing', but note that this is only supported on ScanCentral SAST Controller 22.1+. For older versions, either 'scan' or 'upload' must be specified.
fcli.sc-sast.scan-job.resolver.jobToken = Scan job token.
